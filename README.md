# Pictures of Pooches

## App Description
This app will lift your spirits by showing pictures of dogs. Browse the pics and leave a like or a comment on the dogs you find the cutest. Every 30 seconds, the photo will refresh to show a new pic.

For this project, we utilized an external API, https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random, along with a rest API using json server.

Some challenges that we faced were having the comments and likes persist to just one URL.

**How to install and run the project**

After cloning to your local machine, run the json server to see the comments and likes persist.

`json-server --watch db.json`
